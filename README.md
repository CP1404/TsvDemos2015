# TsvDemos2015
In-class Python code demos for CP1404/CP5632 Townsville, 2015
Lindsay Ward, IT @ James Cook University

Some of this code will be uncommented, commented-out or appear out of context, because it's been used to quickly demo things in lectures.

Includes code for lectures, workshops and exams (just kidding, not exams... hopefully)
